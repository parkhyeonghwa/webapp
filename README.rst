Webapp
======

This is a simple webapp that takes form data and stores it in a mysql database.
In order to run the app, configure the app by copying the example_config.yml
file to config.yml and filling out the configuration options. Then install the
app dependencies in the requirements.txt file and run it. Note that this has
only been tested with python 2, but may also work with python 3.
